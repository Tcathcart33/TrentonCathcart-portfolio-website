            <h3><a href="automated-cooking-smoker.html" target="_blank">Automated Cooking Smoker</a></h3>
            <p>The "Precision Controlled Bytes (PCB) Smoker" is an automated smoker designed by a team of engineers from Missouri University of Science and Technology to revolutionize the culinary experience. This project integrates advanced electrical and control systems into the art of smoking, offering features such as automated temperature control and remote monitoring and adjustment capabilities. Unlike conventional smokers that require constant manual oversight, the PCB Smoker provides precision, convenience, and customization through its user-friendly web interface, allowing both beginners and seasoned enthusiasts to control the smoking process from anywhere. Its open-source design not only promotes community involvement and continuous improvement but also aligns with sustainability associated with traditional smoking methods. This innovative smoker represents a significant leap in culinary technology, aiming to make sophisticated smoking techniques accessible to a broader audience.</p>

            <h3><a href="MachineLearningCircuitComponents.pdf" target="_blank">OURE Circuit Component Recognition</a></h3>
            <p>This project is an innovative venture that combines the power of artificial intelligence with electrical engineering to enhance the learning process for beginners in this field. By employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the project develops a machine learning model capable of accurately recognizing and identifying various circuit components from 2D schematics. This technology streamlines the traditionally manual and tedious process of learning circuit design, making it more accessible and efficient for novices. The project not only demonstrates the model's effectiveness in educational settings but also highlights the broader potential of AI in transforming foundational engineering practices. This initiative represents a significant step forward in integrating cutting-edge AI technologies into electrical engineering education, providing a powerful tool that helps students and professionals alike in understanding and designing complex circuit layouts more intuitively.</p>
